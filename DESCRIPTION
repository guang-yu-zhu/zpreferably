Description: This is an accessible template for 'pkgdown'. It uses two
    bootstrap themes, Flatly and Darkly and utilizes the
    'prefers-color-scheme' CSS variable to automatically serve either of
    the two based on userâ€™s operating system setting, or allowing them to
    manually toggle between them.
